# <password-generator>

## Description

I was sick of struggling to come up with new random passwords, so I created this to make it easier for people to randomize passwords. During this process, I learned how to structure and execute JavaScript logic.

## Usage

To use, simply click the red 'Generate Password' button and follow along with the command prompts as they appear!
